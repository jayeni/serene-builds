## Getting Started

To get started with **Serene Build**, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.\
You may also see linting errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the interactive test runner.\
For more details, see the [Create React App test documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
React is bundled and optimized for the best performance.

The production build is minified, and filenames include hashes.\
Your app will be ready to deploy to any hosting service.

See [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning**: This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone.\
Running `eject` copies all the configuration files and dependencies directly into your project folder, giving you full control over the build setup. Use this only if you need to customize the setup.
